Master Thesis - VUT FIT Brno
This work focuses on the historical development and current trends in the field of flight data visualization in the cockpit. Based on this analysis, a modern flight data visualization is proposed, which is subsequently implemented in a virtual reality-supported aviation simulation environment. The aim of the work was to create flight data visualization for Helmet-Mounted Display for aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing. The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency and safety of aviation through innovative visual means.
